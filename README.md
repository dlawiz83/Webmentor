# WebMentor – Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025

##  What It Is
WebMentor is a Chrome extension that transforms any webpage into an interactive learning guide. It uses Chrome’s built-in AI APIs (Summarizer, Translator, Proofreader, and Rewriter) to help users simplify, summarize, translate, and improve text directly on the page — privately and locally.

##  APIs Used
- Summarizer API  
- Translator API

##  Problem Solved
